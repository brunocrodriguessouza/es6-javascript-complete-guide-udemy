Coding Exercise 2: Processing Values

The array below contains an array of objects, each of which is a representation of an image. Using the forEach helper, calculate the area of each image and store it in a new array called 'areas'. The area of an image can be calculated as 'image.height * image.width.


var images = [
  { height: 10, width: 30 },
  { height: 20, width: 90 },
  { height: 54, width: 32 }
];
var areas = [];


function calculate(image) {
    areas.push(image.height*image.width);
}
images.forEach(calculate);
 
 
handlePosts(); // don't forget to call the function to se something in the console :)
