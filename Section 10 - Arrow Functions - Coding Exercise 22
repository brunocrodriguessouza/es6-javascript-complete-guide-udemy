Coding Exercise 22: Arrow Functions Aren't Always a Solution

Arrow functions bind the value of 'this' to the surrounding context, and sometimes this isn't the the behavior we
expect. The code below has an object that represents a users profile. The profile has a 'name' currently.

Add another key to this object called 'getName'. 'getName' should be a function that returns the profiles
name, using 'this.name'. Does the solution work with a fat arrow function or will you have to use a function
keyword instead?

const profile = {
    name: 'Alex'
};


const profile = {
    name: 'Alex', getName: function(){
        return this.name;
    }
}
