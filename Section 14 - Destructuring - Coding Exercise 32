Coding Exercise 32: Destructuring in Practice

The snippet of code below duplicates references to 'profile' inside of the 'isEngineer' function. Perhaps we
can reduce the amount of code used for referencing the 'title' and 'department' properties. Refactor this
code to use destructuring. Can you get the body of the 'isEngineer' function down to a single line?

const profile = {
  title: 'Engineer',
  department: 'Engineering'
};

function isEngineer(profile) {
  var title = profile.title;
  var department = profile.department;
  return title === 'Engineer' && department === 'Engineering';
}


Solution:

const profile = {
  title: 'Engineer',
  department: 'Engineering'
};

function isEngineer( {title, department}) {

  return title === 'Engineer' && department === 'Engineering';
}

Best solution:

const isEngineer = ({ title, department }) => title === 'Engineer' && department === 'Engineering';
