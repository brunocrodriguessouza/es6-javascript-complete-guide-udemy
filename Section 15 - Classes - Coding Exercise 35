Coding Exercise 35: Game Classes

You are a game developer tasked with setting up some basic classes for a new game you are working on.
Create a class called 'Monster'. In the constructor, you'll need to do some basic setup for Monster
whenever they are created.

	Initialize the Monster's health to 100.
	The constructor will be called with an 'options' object that has a 'name' property. Assign the 'name
to the Monster


Solution:

class Monster {

	constructor({ name }) {
		this.health = 100;
	  	this.name = name;
	}
}

const monster = new Monster({name: 'Buraot'});
