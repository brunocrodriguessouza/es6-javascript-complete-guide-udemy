Coding Exercise 35: Subclassing Monsters

Now that you have a monster created, create a subclass of the Monster called Snake.

	The Snake should have a 'bite' method. The only argument to this method is another instance of a Snake
	The instance of Snake that is passed in should have their health deducated by 10

class Monster {

	constructor({ name }) {
    this.name = name;
		this.health = 100;
	  	
	}
}

class Snake extends Monster{

    constructor(options){

        super(options);

    }

    bite(another){

        return another.health -= 10;

    }

}

const monster = new Monster({name: 'Buraot'});
monster;

const snake = new Snake({name: 'snake'});
snake.bite({health:100});
