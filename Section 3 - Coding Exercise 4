Coding Exercise 4: Calculatin Values with Map

Using map, create a new array that contains the distance / time value from each trip. In other words, the
new array should contain the (distance / time) value. Assign the result to the variable 'speeds'.

var trips = [
  { distance: 34, time: 10 },
  { distance: 90, time: 50 },
  { distance: 59, time: 25 }
];


var speeds = trips.map((trip) => {
    return trip.distance / trip.time
})
