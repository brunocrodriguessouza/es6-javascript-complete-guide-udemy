Coding Exercise 17: A constant Exercise of Letting Variables Be Variables

Imagine that you are building an application to manage a user's Facebook profile. A profile might have a 'name',
 'age', and 'dataOfBirth'.
Declare three varibles with these same names, making sure to use 'const' or 'let' depending on whether
you expect the value to change over time.


let age = 34;
const dateOfBirth = '08081984';
