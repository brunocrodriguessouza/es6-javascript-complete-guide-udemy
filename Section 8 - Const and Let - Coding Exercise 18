Coding Exercise 18: Const and Let Refactoring

The following code uses 'var' instead of 'const' and 'let'. Refactor the function to use the new keywords. Be
sure to consider whether the variable should be declared using 'const' or 'let' depending on whether the 
variable gets reassigned or not.


const statuses = [ 
  { code: 'OK', response: 'Request successful' },
  { code: 'FAILED', response: 'There was an error with your request' },
  { code: 'PENDING', response: 'Your reqeust is still pending' }
];

let message = '';
const currentCode = 'OK';

for (let i = 0; i < statuses.length; i++) {
  if (statuses[i].code === currentCode) {
    message = statuses[i].response;
  }
}
